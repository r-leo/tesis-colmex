## What is this

This repository stores the code used to perform the statistical estimation of an asset valuation model that I am currently working on. The model constitutes the central part of my thesis project (Economics) at COLMEX. The datasets are publicly availlable online, and the sources are cited below. All the mathematical details and theoretical results are written down in the main body of the thesis document, which will available once it is (hopefully) approved.
