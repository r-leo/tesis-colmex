# tesis-colmex

## What is this

This repository stores the code used to perform the statistical estimation of an asset valuation model that I am currently working on. The model constitutes the central part of my thesis project (Economics) at COLMEX. The datasets are publicly availlable online, and the sources are cited below. All the mathematical details and theoretical results are written down in the main body of the thesis document, which will available once it is (hopefully) approved.

## The files (start here)

* The raw Jupyter code is the file [ajuste_modelo.ipynb](ajuste_modelo.ipynb).
* An HTML export is available at [ajuste_modelo.html](ajuste_modelo.html).
* Probably the HTML file is too big for the GitHub webpage to handle, and sometimes the Jupyter code isn't properly executed here. So, if everything else fails, there is a PDF export at [ajuste_modelo.pdf](ajuste_modelo.pdf).

It is always possible, however, to download the .ipynb file and execute it (don't forget the data file at [datos.xlsx](datos.xlsx)), or to download the HTML file and take a look at it from a local browser.
